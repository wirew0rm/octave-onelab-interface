//Numbers that caracterise the interior of the square (Omega) and its boundary (Gama):
Omega = 1000;

// Three remarks on these numbers :
// - They are arbitrary choosen.
// - They are placed in a separated file to be readable by both GMSH and GetDP.
// - "Gamma" is a special word used by GMSH/GetDP, that is why the boundary is named "Gama", with one "m"...
// Do not forget to let a blank line at the end, this could make GMSH crash...
